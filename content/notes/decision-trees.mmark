## 1. Overview
Decision Tree a **supervised learning algorithms** that can be used for **classification or regression predictive** 
modeling but mostly used in classification problems. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as **decision trees**. The representation for 
the CART model is a **binary tree**.

## 2. Intuition
A **binary tree** is a **tree data structure** in which each node has at most **two children**, which are referred to as 
the **left child and the right child**. Thus in decision tree, the input population or sample is split into two 
homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on **most significant** ` splitter / criteria / differentiator` 
in input variables as below.

**How splitter is selected?**
  The `splitter` is selected based on the `purity` of the **outcomes** . 
 
**What is the `purity`?**
 Measures how `homogenious` the **subsets** belong to a class after splitting.
 Also the `impurity` results in when we have a traces of one class division into other. 
 
 
Ideally pick an attribute that splits the population/set into pure subsets.

The well known Pythagorean theorem blah blah $$ x^2=y^2 $$ blah blah was
proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

$$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$

Here's an example:
