      <description>1. Overview Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful class of models used for nonlinear regression and classification tasks inspired by biological neural computation. Significance of this notes is to give the clarity and completeness on the Neural Network Learning process and mathematics behind it!
2. Neural Network Learning Neural Network consist of input, hidden, or output layers. There is only one input layer and one output layer but the number of hidden layers is unlimited.</description>

      <description>1. Overview Decision Tree a supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modeling but mostly used in classification problems. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees. The representation for the CART model is a binary tree.
2. Intuition A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.</description>
